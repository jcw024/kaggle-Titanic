# kaggle-Titanic

my own implementation of a kaggle kernel (found at https://www.kaggle.com/omarelgabry/a-journey-through-titanic) for learning purposes
slightly modified to run on a linux command line instead of a jupyter notebook
made some other small modifications, like cross validation of data, saving plots as png files, cleaning up the output
